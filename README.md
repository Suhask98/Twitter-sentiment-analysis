# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

Twitter has millions of tweets coming up every hour or so. The main motivation for this project was to make tweet classification easier through machine learning. Customer satisfaction is the primary focus for any company so determining through this classifier makes it easier to develop strategies for better customer satisfaction. 

I've used Logistic regression here as it had the highest accuracy for the training set.

Basically I have depicted word clouds for both racist and non racist tweets for each training set and for predicted test set as well.
